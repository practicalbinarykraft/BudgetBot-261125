# /migrations/ (Drizzle-Kit Generated)

**This directory is NOT the active migration source.**

These files were generated by `drizzle-kit` (`npx drizzle-kit generate`)
and applied via `npx drizzle-kit push` during early development.

## Active migration system

All production migrations are managed through:

```
server/migrations/    <-- single source of truth
scripts/migrate.ts    <-- migration runner CLI
```

Commands:
- `npm run db:migrate`          — apply pending migrations
- `npm run db:migrate:status`   — show applied/pending
- `npm run db:migrate:create`   — create new migration file
- `npm run db:migrate:validate` — verify checksums

## Do NOT use this directory for new migrations

New migrations must go in `server/migrations/` using the runner.
This directory is kept for historical reference only.
